### My Commands

In here you will find a list of all Miunie's commands. They come with a small description and exceptions 
(these are exceptions on when the command will not properly execute. N/A means there are no exceptions.)
Each command will also be shown with a gif of the command being executed.

Items between `<>` are mandatory and items between `[]` are optional.
